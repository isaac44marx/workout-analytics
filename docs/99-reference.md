You’ll paste real snippets here as you encounter them.

## How to use it effectively (important)
- Add snippets **when you learn them**, not ahead of time
- Keep explanations short
- This file is allowed to be ugly
- Search it often instead of Googling repeatedly

It becomes *your* reference, not generic docs.

## One small but helpful habit
When you solve something tricky:
1. Paste the working snippet into `99-reference.md`
2. Add **one line** explaining when to use it

That’s how you actually retain syntax.

## Project Concepts
A web app has two essential pieces:

A server

a program that listens for HTTP requests

responds with HTML, JSON, etc.

A client (browser)

sends HTTP requests

renders the responses

“Web app” does not automatically mean “on the internet.”
